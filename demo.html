								A client side router provides state management. What? A route is a URL. A state is the 
								active data and appearance of the application. So when the url changes, the router performs some
								work and then the application mutates, but doesn't have to reload the page. This is especially 
								great for making web sites feel more responsive, like desktop apps.<br/><br/>
								
								SugarSkull uses <b>HTML5 pushState</b> and falls back to older techniques to 
								support all browsers.
								<br/><br/>
								Click <a href="#foobar">here</a> to try to enter a route that does not exist.

						</div>
				
						<div id="how" class="router-context">
							<div class="content">
								We divide the url into two parts. First the server-side (everything before the '<span class="red">#</span>'), and then
								the client-side (everything after the '<span class="red">#</span>'). The second part is called the HashRoute.
								The hash route looks like this...
								<br/><br/>
								<center>
								<img src="img/hashRoute.png" width="598" height="113" alt="HashRoute">
								</center>
								We keep track of what happens to the url, if it changes, we fire off some function(s) that you have specified.

								<b>Single-page apps</b> reduce unnecessary page-reloads, and enhance the overall user experience with responsiveness. 
								But with this technique comes many <b>edge cases</b>.
								<br/><br/>
								For example, let's say a route want's to show some new content. Content relative only to other routes needs to 
								hide, but each route's functions shouldn't have to duplicate the code that manages this. What about when leaving 
								a route or when leaving all routes, you may want to preform some cleanup. etc. etc.
								<br/><br/>
								SugarSkull addresses a long list of edge cases with a very simple API.
								<br/><br/>
								<b>This demo</b> illustrates how you can build
								single pages apps quickly and easily.

								<h3>Whats happening in this demo</h3>
								<ul>
									<li>bookmark a 'page', go back to it, and see the state restored.</li>
									<li>route can have many parts <a href=""></a></li>
								</ul>
								<h3>Simple Configuration</h3>
								Configuration is done through an object literal
								<pre><code>
var router = SS.router(this, {

	"about": { // a RegExp

		on: ["about"]
	},

	"how": { // ([a-zA-Z0-9_\-]+)
		on: ["how"]
	},

	"why": {
		on: ["why"]
	},

	"demoExplanation": {
		on: ["demo"]
	},				

     // there are a few optional methods for convenience, they 

	notfound: {

	  // you can define a function anywhere and refer to it here with its function name or you
	  // can specify a string that represents a function name which belongs to the hostObject
	  // (the object that is specified as the first parameter of the router). No other methods are
	  // fired if this the route is 'not found'.

		on: [notFound] 
	},

	beforeall: {
	  on: ["beforeall"]
	},

	afterall: {
	  on: ["afterall"]
	},				

     leaveall: {
       on: ["leaveall"]
     }

});
